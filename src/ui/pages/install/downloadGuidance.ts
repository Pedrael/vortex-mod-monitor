 * Telling someone how to fetch a mod we cannot fetch for them.
 *
 * Vortex's own answer to a browse-website dependency is an embedded browser.
 * We deliberately do not do that. An in-app browser is signed out of every
 * site the user has an account on, handles a CAPTCHA or a Cloudflare check
 * badly or not at all, has no ad-blocker, no password manager, and no download
 * manager — so the one flow where a person most needs their own environment is
 * the one where they are given the worst version of it.
 *
 * So: open the link in THEIR browser, let them download it however they
 * normally would, and take the archive back as a file. From that point the
 * install is ours — including the curator's FOMOD choices, which the picked
 * file now replays (see adoptLocalArchive).
 *
 * ── Why the mode matters ──
 * `browse`, `direct` and `manual` are three different actions, and the
 * instruction has to match or it is worse than none:
 *
 *   browse  — a mod PAGE. "Find the right file on the page" is the work.
 *   direct  — a link straight to the file. Clicking it just downloads; telling
 *             someone to "find the file on the page" would send them looking
 *             for a page that never appears.
 *   manual  — no usable link. The curator's prose is all there is, and
 *             pretending otherwise wastes the reader's time.
 *
 * Absent mode is treated as `browse`: a link we inferred is far more likely to
 * be a page than a direct file, and "look for the file" degrades gracefully if
 * a download starts anyway, where the reverse does not.
