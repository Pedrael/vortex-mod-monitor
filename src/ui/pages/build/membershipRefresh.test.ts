/**
 * `loadBuildContext` runs once, when the form opens. Every build after that
 * reused its snapshot — so toggling a mod in Vortex and pressing Build again
 * shipped the OLD membership, silently. Measured: a rebuild produced a mod set
 * identical to the previous one down to every compareKey, with no
 * load-context pass in the log at all.
 *
 * This is the staleness a fingerprinted hash cache structurally cannot catch:
 * nothing about the files changed, only which files count.
