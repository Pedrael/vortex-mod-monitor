/**
 * This is the only code in the project that DELETES the user's own work, and
 * it deletes more than the collection touches: Vortex stores mod rules on the
 * mod and the LOOT userlist per game, so neither is scoped to a profile.
 *
 * The contract it has to keep is therefore narrow and absolute:
 *   - remove exactly what was captured, never more;
 *   - never run at all unless the backup was written first.
 *
 * Both are tested by making them fail.
