/**
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Which archive files are missing from staging *because Vortex lost them*?
 *
 * `verifyStagingAgainstArchive` already reports `archiveEntriesNotStaged` —
 * every archive entry whose content appears nowhere in the curator's staging
 * folder. That is the omission signal, and until now nothing consumed it,
 * because on its own it is not usable: measured at **8.5%** of entries on a
 * real profile and dominated by files that were never meant to be installed.
 *
 * The FOMOD script disambiguates it perfectly, but only **~17%** of archives
 * contain one — despite Vortex labelling almost every mod `installerType:
 * "fomod"`, which means "handled by the fomod installer", not "has a script".
 * So for ~83% of mods there is no declared expected set, and the question is
 * whether the raw signal can be split without one.
 *
 * It can, because the two populations have different SHAPES:
 *
 *  - A file that was never installed belongs to a directory that is absent in
 *    its ENTIRETY — an unselected option folder, a docs folder, `fomod/`.
 *    Nothing in it staged, because nothing in it was ever meant to.
 *  - A file Vortex LOST belongs to a directory that is otherwise present. A
 *    dropped write during a bulk install leaves a folder with holes in it —
 *    37 of 40 textures staged, three gone.
 *
 * Directory cohesion is therefore the discriminator, and it needs nothing but
 * the archive listing we already have. A wholly-absent directory is suppressed;
 * a partially-present one yields a lead.
 *
 * ## Presence is tested by PATH, not by content
 *
 * Containment (`verifyStagingAgainstArchive`) deliberately matches by content,
 * because a FOMOD renames files on install. That is right for its question —
 * "did these staged bytes come from the archive?" — and wrong for this one.
 * Measured over 60 real mods, content matching produced 169 high leads across
 * 10 mods, nearly all of them artefacts: the build passes staged files with no
 * crc, so matching degrades to SIZE ALONE and small `.ini` files collide with
 * unrelated same-size files, manufacturing half-present directories.
 *
 * Path matching removes that. Vortex strips a leading wrapper directory, so the
 * ARCHIVE path is usually the longer one (`01 Main/meshes/x.nif` staged as
 * `meshes/x.nif`); a FOMOD `destination` can add a prefix instead, so the tail
 * is compared in both directions.
 *
 * ## Archives that declare alternatives get no answer at all
 *
 * An archive containing a FOMOD script offers options, and this module cannot
 * tell an unchosen one from a lost file — parallel option folders even share
 * basenames, so the selected option's files tail-match the unselected ones and
 * manufacture partial directories. Measured: excluding FOMOD archives took the
 * raw signal from 750 entries to 36 and the leads from 77-in-6-mods to
 * 8-in-1-mod, while recall against simulated losses held at 93%.
 *
 * Those mods are not abandoned — they are exactly the ones `fomodReplay`
 * answers authoritatively. This module covers the ~83% it cannot.
 *
 * Extension cohesion sharpens it further. A folder of 40 staged `.dds` missing
 * three more `.dds` is a strong lead; the same folder missing one `.txt` is
 * almost certainly a readme that the installer skipped. So a missing entry
 * whose extension also appears among its STAGED siblings ranks `high`, and one
 * whose extension appears nowhere alongside it ranks `medium`.
 *
 * These are LEADS, never verdicts — the same discipline the rest of this area
 * follows. A wrong "missing" claim is worse than no claim: it sends the curator
 * to reinstall a mod that was never broken. Nothing here decides anything; it
 * ranks what a human should look at first.
